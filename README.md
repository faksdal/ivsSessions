# ivsSessions

Reads and lists ivs master files in the terminal. Not completely done yet, but if you wanna have a crack at it, be my guest.

## Description

You should be able to make it using make in the terminal. You need of course the build tools installed on your system.
Be adviced: make depends on two folders in builder root: "bin" and "obj"!

It takes one parameter, -i "name of input file"

The input file would be the master text files from https://ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov/program/index.html
